# BioCypher governance
Shallow repository to organise biocontext governance, mainly by issues and discussions.

For open questions for the ecosystem, open an [issue](https://github.com/biocypher/issues/issues/new) in our dedicated `issues` repository, after checking that a similar one does not exist yet. A good place to check is the overarching [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/biocypher/projects/1).

For larger scopes of problem, we use the Discussion function of GitHub. It is enabled in the [organisation scope](https://github.com/orgs/biocypher/discussions). Some repositories also have their own Discussions enabled.
